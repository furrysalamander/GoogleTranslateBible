# GoogleTranslateBible
I wanted to know what would happen if you ran the Bible's original text through Google Translate.
This is a very simple program to automate that.

Code is super ugly.  Its only purpose is to parse text downloaded from http://www.tanach.us/Pages/Technical.html
The program takes one verse at a time, and runs it through the Google Translate API.  You'll need to set up the Google Translate API, and obtain a key to use it in your program.  You'll also have to set the environment variable.
(See https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart for details)

I'm including the files I parsed, and the output.  Stay tuned for the New Testament...
